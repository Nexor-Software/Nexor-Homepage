            <h3 class="text-xl font-oswald font-normal text-white mb-4">3.1 Scope of Processing Personal Data</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
              We process personal data of our users only to the extent necessary to provide a functional website as well as our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users generally takes place only after consent from the user. An exception applies in cases where prior obtaining of consent is not possible for factual reasons and the processing of the data is permitted by legal regulations.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-oswald font-normal text-white mb-4">3.2 Legal Basis for the Processing of Personal Data</h3>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
              To the extent that we obtain consent from the data subject for processing operations of personal data, Article 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as the legal basis.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
              When processing personal data necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Article 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to processing operations necessary for carrying out pre-contractual measures.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
              To the extent that processing of personal data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which our company is subject, Article 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
              If the processing is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of our company or a third party and the interests, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not outweigh the former interest, Article 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for the processing.
            </p>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-oswald font-normal text-white mb-4">3.3 Data Deletion and Storage Duration</h3>
            <p class="text-lg">
              The personal data of the data subject will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of storage ceases to apply. Storage may take place beyond this if this has been provided for by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other provisions to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the aforementioned standards expires, unless there is a necessity for further storage of the data for the conclusion of a contract or contract performance.
