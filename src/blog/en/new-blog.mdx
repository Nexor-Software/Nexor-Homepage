# Getting Started with Astro

Astro is revolutionizing how we build modern websites. This guide will help you get started with Astro and understand why it's becoming so popular.

## What is Astro?

Astro is a web framework designed for building fast, content-focused websites. It allows you to use your favorite UI components and libraries while shipping zero JavaScript by default.

## Key Features

### 1. Component Islands

Astro introduces the concept of "component islands" - interactive components surrounded by static HTML.

```astro
---
// Static content
---
<html>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <!-- Interactive island -->
    <Counter client:load />
  </body>
</html>
```

### 2. Multi-Framework Support

Use React, Vue, Svelte, or even plain HTML components in the same project.

### 3. Built-in Optimization

Astro automatically optimizes your build, splitting CSS and JavaScript only where needed.
