# The Future of Web Development

Web development is evolving rapidly. Here are some trends we expect for 2025 and beyond.

## React Server Components

Server Components are revolutionizing how we build React applications. They enable server-side rendering of components and send only necessary data to the client.

```jsx
// Example of Server Components
export default function BlogPost({ post }) {
	return (
		<article>
			<h1>{post.title}</h1>
			<p>{post.content}</p>
		</article>
	);
}
```

## Edge Computing

Edge Computing brings data processing closer to the user. This means faster loading times and better performance for global applications.

## AI-Powered Development

Artificial Intelligence will simplify and accelerate development. From code generation to automated testing - AI will become an indispensable partner for developers.

## Our Approach

At Nexor Software, we stay at the forefront of technology and integrate the latest innovations into our projects to provide our clients with the best solutions.
